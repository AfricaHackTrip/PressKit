Objective
---------

We want to explore and connect with the emerging African tech communities,
get to know their creatives, learn about their projects, challenges and
potentials. We'll document our experiences to "fill the blank canvas",
replace stereotypes with human stories and spark interest to connect 
and collaborate with new members of our global tech communities.


Execution
---------

Starting in June 2013, we will visit the tech communities of Nairobi,
Kampala, Kigali and Dar es Salaam and stay at each place for around a
week. We'll visit with 10 creatives from Europe and the United States,
with two additional places reserved for local participants.

During our journey, we will collaborate with local developers to work
on open source projects, to learn from each other and to exchange
experiences our experiences. We also plan to organize an event at each
location we will visit.

As an outcome, we will create a video documentation showcasing the
communities, their coworking spaces and their developers.
