Find all information regarding the AfricaHackTrip Project in this Folder.


Objective
---------

We want to explore the emerging African tech communities, get to know
their creatives, learn about their projects, problems and potentials.
We'll document our experiences to "fill the blank canvas", get rid of
unfounded stereotypes and spark interest in the global tech communities
to connect and collaborate with our new African members.


Execution
---------

Starting in June 2013, we will visit the tech communities of Nairobi,
Kampala, Kigali and Dar es Salaam and stay at each place for around a
week. We'll visit with 10 creatives from Europe and the United States,
with two additional places reserved for local participants.

During our journey, we will collaborate with local developers to work
on open source projects, to learn from each other and to exchange
experiences our experiences. We also plan to organize an event at each
location we will visit.

During our journey, we will create a video documentation show casing the
coworking spaces and their developers.
